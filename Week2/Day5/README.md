## Overview

The Library Management System is a software application that is designed to manage a library's catalog. It helps in keeping track of books, their availability, and borrowers. The Library Management System is designed to help librarians to manage their library easily and efficiently.

## Features

The Library Management System provides the following features:

```
* Add new books to the library catalog
* Remove books from the library catalog
* Update book information (title, author, genre, etc.)
* View the list of all books in the library
* Search for books by title or author
* Borrow a book
* Return a book
* View the list of borrowed books
```

## Classes

- The Library Management System has the following classes:

### Book

- The Book class represents a single book in the library with properties such as title, author, genre, and availability.

### Catalog

- The Catalog class contains a list of all books in the library and methods for adding, removing, updating, and searching for books.

### Borrower    

- The Borrower class represents a person who borrows a book and contains information such as name and borrowed books.

### BorrowedBook

- The BorrowedBook class represents a book that has been borrowed and contains information such as the borrower's name and due date.

## Implementation

- The Library Management System is implemented in Java and uses fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and variables. Basic data structures such as arrays or lists are used to manage the list of books in the catalog and the list of borrowed books. Control flow statements such as if-else statements and loops are used to implement the search and borrowing features.

## Future Improvements

- In future I will enhance the project more by adding proper acknowledgements and adding a login system to this project.
