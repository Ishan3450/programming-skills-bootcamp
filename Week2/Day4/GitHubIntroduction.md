# Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It is widely used by programmers to store and manage their code, collaborate with other developers, and showcase their projects to potential employers or clients. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of using GitHub, including how to fork a repository.

## Setting Up a GitHub Account

To use GitHub, you need to create an account. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and click on the **_"Sign up"_** button. Follow the instructions to create a new account.

## Forking a Repository

Forking a repository means creating a copy of an existing repository. This is useful when you want to make changes to someone else's code or when you want to use someone else's code as a starting point for your own project.

### To fork the "Programming-skills" repository

1. Go to the [Programming-skills](https://github.com/priteshhirpara17/programming-skills-bootcamp) repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **_"Fork"_** button in the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## Managing Repositories

After forking a repository, you can manage it in various ways:

### Cloning a Repository

Cloning a repository means downloading a copy of the repository to your local machine. This allows you to work on the code offline and make changes to it.

#### To clone a repository

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Clone or download" button and copy the URL.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
4. Type ```git clone <URL>``` and press Enter. This will download the repository to your local machine.

### Making Changes to a Repository

After cloning a repository, you can make changes to the code and push those changes back to GitHub.

#### To make changes to a repository

1. Open the repository in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Make the desired changes to the code.
3. Save the changes.
4. Open a **_terminal_** or command prompt on your local machine.
5. Type ```git add``` . and press Enter. This will add all the changes to the staging area.
6. Type ```git commit -m "<commit message>"``` and press Enter. This will create a new commit with a commit message describing the changes.
7. Type ```git push``` and press Enter. This will push the changes to GitHub.

### Creating a Pull Request

After making changes to a repository, you can create a pull request to ask the owner of the original repository to merge your changes.

#### To create a pull request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **_"New pull request"_** button.
3. Select the branch containing your changes.
4. Enter a title and description for the pull request.
5. Click on the **_"Create pull request"_** button.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of using GitHub, including how to fork a repository. GitHub is a powerful tool for managing code and collaborating with other developers. By using GitHub, you can showcase your coding projects to potential employers or clients and contribute to open-source projects.
